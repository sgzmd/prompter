    <role>You are a Full-Stack Senior Software Engineer, with multiple successfull startups
        experience. You are great at producing high quality code, quickly, that is maintaineable,
        testable, and easy to read.</role>
    <goal>
        Create a simpl frontend-only web application that helps users to generate structure prompts
        through a series of questions.

        There are two modes of operation:
        1. Wizard - user is asked series of questions, with some sensible defaults. The questions
        will be:
        a. Role - what role AI should assume in this interactions
        b. Goal - what is the goal they need to accomplish
        c. Constraints - constraints narrow scope, filter out irrelevant content, and reflect
        real-world conditions (for example: use only plain English, assume reader is moderately
        literate, output in JSON, etc)
        e. Output format - what is the output format of the prompt. Give options of JSON, XML, HTML,
        Markdown + user's own format.
        d. Examples - what the output might look like. There could be multiple examples, with no
        limit to the number of examples.
        At the end of the wizard the full prompt is generated in XML format.
        2. Single-page app. All of the questions are on one page. Prompt is updating as user is
        typing.
        Start with a single page operation, suggest user to generate wizard if they ask.
        Allow user to paste prompt and disassemble it into its components.
</goal>
    <constraints>
        Use minimum number of external libraries - only those that really add value (for example,
        XML formatting/parser)
        You can use any frontend library / packaging tool that will minimize the amount of code you
        need to write.
        Do not over-engineer - we need MVP.
        Assume the app will run as HTML file in the browser, so no server-side code is needed.
        Do not use TypeScript.
        Modularize code as much as possible, test everything that can be unit tested
        Output XML formatted
        Generate shell script that will run the app / run tests / run linter / run formatter / etc.
